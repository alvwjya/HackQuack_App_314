This an explanation on how to do github stuff(we Know you know how to do this alvian)

1. Create branch or just select to work on branch:
   -    Creating a branch is only necessary if you need to add something that doesnt fall under the umbrella of existing branches.
2. Do your changes then push your changes to the branch
3. After that go to the top where it says current branch <name of your branch> and select the main branch; after doing that you should be in the main branch.
4. Now go back to the button you used to change the branches and there should be a merge branch button, click it and it will give the option to select a branch to merge to the main. Select your new branch.
5. Wait until desktop tells you its done then select the push to origin and it should be done.
